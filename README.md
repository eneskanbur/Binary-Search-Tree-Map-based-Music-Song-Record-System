# Music Song Record System

## Overview
The Music Song Record System is a Java application designed to manage and search for songs. It uses AVL Trees to store song data and provides efficient search functionality.

## Features
- **Song Management**: The system reads song data from a text file and stores it in an array. Each song has a name, artist, id, genre, and year.
- **AVL Trees**: The system uses AVL Trees to store song data. Separate trees are created for song names, ids, and artists.
- **Search Functionality**: The system provides multiple search methods. Users can search for songs by name, id, or artist. The system also supports range searches based on song id.
- **Deletion**: The system allows users to delete a song based on its id. The song is removed from all AVL Trees.
